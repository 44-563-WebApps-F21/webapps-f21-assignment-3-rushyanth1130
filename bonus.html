            The Mandarin is a superb athlete with tremendous skill in the various martial arts.             
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Through repeated practice, he has toughened all the striking surfaces of his body, especially his hands, which are covered with thick calluses. 
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            He can even split Iron Man's magnetic-beam reinforced alloy armor with repeated blows. 
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            So great is the Mandarin's martial arts ability, that he can even survive years without food and water, apparently sustaining himself purely via his mastery of chi.
