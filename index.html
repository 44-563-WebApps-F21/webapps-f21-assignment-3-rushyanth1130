        Favorite Location : Sydney
    </h6>
    <p>
        <b>Sydney is famous for its beaches.</b> Mostly Bondi Beach but there are so many other great (better in my opinion) 
        beaches scattered all along this coastal city and with Sydney’s perfect climate it is 
        <b>warm enough to be visiting the beaches about eight months of the year.</b>
        A large amount of my life has been spent on the beaches of Sydney.

    <h2>Extended Euclidean algorithm</h2> 
    <blockquote>
        In arithmetic and computer programming, the <b>extended Euclidean algorithm</b> is an extension to the 
        Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the 
        greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers a and b, also the coefficients of Bézout's identity, 
        which are integers x and y such that ax+by=\gcd(a,b).<br/>
