        Favorite Location : Sydney

    <p>
        <b>Sydney is famous for its beaches.</b> Mostly Bondi Beach but there are so many other great (better in my opinion) 
        beaches scattered all along this coastal city and with Sydneyâ€™s perfect climate it is 
        <b>warm enough to be visiting the beaches about eight months of the year.</b>
        A large amount of my life has been spent on the beaches of Sydney.
